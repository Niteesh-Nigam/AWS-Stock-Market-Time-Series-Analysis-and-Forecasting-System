# Stock Market Data Pipeline and Real-Time Forecasting System

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end system that:
- Stores stock market data on AWS.
- Generates synthetic data using the GPT API.
- Performs real-time forecasting and anomaly detection.
- Leverages existing models and techniques to improve efficiency.

The dataset comprises multiple stock exchange files, likely containing time series data (open, high, low, close prices, trading volume) for various exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This data is ideal for forecasting and anomaly detection.

## Milestones and Project Plan

### **Milestone 1: Understand and Prepare Data**
- **1.1 Data Exploration & Analysis**: Analyze the dataset structure, granularity, and key features. Clean and preprocess data.
- **1.2 Define Data Schema**: Identify essential columns (timestamp, open, close, high, low, volume) and define a consistent schema for AWS storage.

**Deliverables:**
- Cleaned dataset for AWS storage.
- Exploratory analysis reports and summary statistics.

---

### **Milestone 2: Data Storage on AWS**
- **2.1 Set Up AWS Database**: Choose AWS RDS or DynamoDB, configure roles, and security groups.

**Deliverables:**
- Deployed forecasting and anomaly detection models.
- Integrated real-time pipeline.

---

### **Milestone 6: Leverage Existing Insights**
- **6.1 Study ARIMA Notebook**: Analyze the provided notebook to improve model accuracy and efficiency.

**Deliverables:**
- List of improvements based on the ARIMA notebook.
- Implemented features from the notebook.

---

### **Milestone 7: Front-End Dashboard (Optional)**
- **7.1 Create Dashboard**: Use Amazon QuickSight/Power BI for real-time visualization.
- **7.2 Set Alerts**: Configure CloudWatch for anomaly detection alerts.

**Deliverables:**
- Real-time data visualization dashboard.
- CloudWatch alarms for anomalies.

---

### **Milestone 8: Testing, Deployment, and Scalability**
